# Golden Thread Traceability Framework

## Overview

The **Golden Thread Framework** provides end-to-end traceability from business requirements through architecture, implementation, testing, and deployment. This ensures every line of code can be traced back to a business need, and every business requirement can be traced forward to its implementation.

## Why Use Golden Thread Traceability?

### Benefits

✅ **Accountability**: Every code change ties to a business requirement  
✅ **Completeness**: Ensure all requirements are implemented  
✅ **Impact Analysis**: Understand what's affected when requirements change  
✅ **Audit Trail**: Track decisions and their rationale  
✅ **Onboarding**: New developers understand *why* code exists  
✅ **Quality**: Requirements drive testing, ensuring coverage  

### The Problem Without It

❌ Orphaned code with unknown purpose  
❌ Missed requirements discovered late  
❌ Unclear impact of changes  
❌ Difficulty understanding architectural decisions  
❌ Technical debt accumulation

### Step 2: Understand the Template Structure

The template contains interconnected databases that maintain traceability:

```
Business Requirements (BR-*)
    ↓
User Requirements (UR-*)
    ↓
Features (FEAT-*)
    ↓
Functional Requirements (FR-*)
Technical & System Requirements (TSR-*)
Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-*)
    ↓
Interface Registry (IF-*)
Call Flows (CF-*)
    ↓
REST Endpoints (REST-*)
GraphQL Operations (GQL-*)
gRPC Methods (RPC-*)
Events (EVT-*)
    ↓
Verification Matrix (V-*)
    ↓
Test Cases (TC-*)
    ↓
Evidence Artifacts (EA-*)
```

Each database has **relations** to upstream and downstream items, creating the "golden thread."

## Step-by-Step Population Guide

### Phase 1: Start with Business Requirements (Anchor Point)

**Business Requirements** are the foundation. Start here before writing any code.

#### 1.1: Identify Business Needs

Ask stakeholders:
- What business problem are we solving?
- What value does this provide?
- What are the success metrics?
- Who are the users?

#### 1.2: Create Business Requirement Records

**Template Fields:**
- **BR ID**: `BR-[DOMAIN]-[NUMBER]` (e.g., `BR-MON-001` for "Monetization 001")
- **Title**: Clear, business-focused name
- **Description**: What business value this provides
- **Priority**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- **Stakeholder**: Who requested this
- **Success Metrics**: How we measure success

**Example:**
```
BR-MON-001: Multi-Tenant Account Management
Description: Enable users to create accounts and manage billing 
             to support our SaaS business model
Priority: Critical
Stakeholder: VP of Product

1. **Requirements Completion Dashboard**
   - Group by: Business Requirement
   - Show: Linked features, tasks, tests, deployment status
   - Filter: Status != Complete

2. **Sprint Board**
   - Group by: Status (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done)
   - Show: Tasks only
   - Filter: Current sprint

3. **Test Coverage Matrix**
   - Group by: User Requirement
   - Show: All linked test cases
   - Highlight: Missing test coverage

4. **Deployment Timeline**
   - Timeline view of deployment records
   - Group by: Environment
   - Show: Features included in each deployment

### Key Metrics to Track

- **Traceability Coverage**: % of tasks linked to URs
- **Requirement Completion**: % of URs fully implemented
- **Test Coverage**: % of URs with passing tests
- **Orphaned Work**: Tasks not linked to any feature
- **Cycle Time**: Days from BR created to deployed

## Team Adoption

### For Product Managers

- **Start with BR**: Define business value first
- **Use AI**: Generate user stories from business needs
- **Track Progress**: Monitor UR completion rates
- **Communicate**: Share Notion views with stakeholders

### For Architects

- **Document Technical Requirements**: Capture architectural decisions
- **Review Features**: Ensure technical feasibility
- **Maintain Diagrams**: Link architecture docs to features
- **Plan Sprints**: Use task breakdown for estimation

### For Developers

- **Reference Tasks**: Check Notion before coding
- **Update Status**: Keep task status current
- **Link Commits**: Reference TASK IDs in commits
- **Add Notes**: Document implementation details

### For QA Engineers

- **Create Tests**: Define test cases from acceptance criteria
- **Track Coverage**: Ensure all URs have tests
- **Report Bugs**: Link bugs to failing tests and URs
- **Update Status**: Mark tests as passing/failing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Too many orphaned tasks  
**Solution**: Enforce linking during task creation, weekly audits

**Problem**: Duplicate requirements  
**Solution**: Search before creating, use consistent naming

**Problem**: Broken links after deletion  
**Solution**: Check relations before deleting, use archive instead

**Problem**: Team not adopting  
**Solution**: Make it easy (templates), show value (metrics), enforce in reviews

**Problem**: Notion getting cluttered  
**Solution**: Archive completed items, use filters, create focused views
